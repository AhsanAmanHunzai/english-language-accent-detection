And as you do this, you might want to hold your throat just so you can notice whether it is expanding on the vowel because it should be expanding on the vowel. And for some people, some German speakers, they find themselves contracting because then it makes them more aware of these muscles. But actually we need to expand. It's all about expansion allowing the vowel sound to propel backwards. So the strontiatures, we're actually putting the tongue outside the mouth and then pulling it back in again. So you might want to just put your finger against your lips so you can feel your tongue hitting your finger and then you'll know that it's gone outside your mouth. But I'll just do it without my finger fast so you can see. Think, thought, thank. So I'm actually pulling my tongue against my teeth. So you should very much feel that the kind of scrape of your teeth against the tip of the tongue. But at the same time, our focus needs to be on the back of the mouth and that expansion in order to allow the vowel sound to resonate at the back. Otherwise, you'll just be a bit lispy kind of think, rather than think. So we're really activating these muscles here as well. So let's just do an exercise so you can feel those muscles. Now this exercise is called stipling a smile. So it's just like to have a go. So we're just going to smile and then really hold that smile back. And you should just feel these muscles, these tiny muscles activating here in the lower jaw. Thought three. And I can also put my finger against my lips so that I can feel my tongue touching my finger and then aware that my tongue has gone outside my mouth. Thought. Thank. And that's quite helpful. Okay, let's do some sentences. And I'm going to focus on the word thought here. So I'm just going to also fill you in on how to pronounce the vowel. So for this vowel sound, it's a long vowel. And the tip of the tongue needs to be positioned below the bottom teeth. And then we're relaxing the back of the tongue and opening up the back of the mouth. So we start here or. And because it's a sound which has an O in it, we need to round the lips. So it's or and thought. So let's try a sentence with this word. I thought, I thought, but the thought I thought wasn't the thought I thought. I'm going to slow down for you now so you can repeat after me. I thought a thought. But the thought I thought wasn't the thought I thought. And now I'm going to do a sentence which combines both the strong and the weak TH. So let's see how it goes. Her 33rd birthday was on the third Thursday of this month. And you'll notice that the TH at the end of month is also a soft one. So we have soft THs at the end of words like month and both and with. And for these ones, you really need to focus on the vowel sound, which means you really need to focus on increasing that space at the back of the mouth. So it's where. And I'm really opening up the back of my mouth so it's almost like a cave. And you can imagine that the sound is actually going right out the back of your head. And that's what's occurring in essence. So you may find it useful to go back to the beginning of this video and watch again because we have covered an awful lot, but I hope you find it useful.",
